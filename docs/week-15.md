Thank you for taking the time to read this week's update. As you can see in the following table, I have a couple of activities planned that I will do in order to get my desired result: Time for deployment with Vercel.

# The deployment process

As you can see, it's extremely easy to deploy. All I need to do is that I make sure the GitHub repo is linked to my Vercel account, push my code to the master branch, and then it will automatically deploy!

This is what that looks like in Vercel:

I can even see the build logs for each push!

To finish off this week I invite you to take a look at the [finalized website](https://astroplant.now.sh/). Created with Next.js, deployed with Vercel :)

I've had so much fun learning this new platform! It went extremely well. The only thing I do want to dive deeper in with the portfolio website for block 4 of this minor, is the Markdown as a data source. Should be a lot of fun :)
