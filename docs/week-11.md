Thank you for taking the time to read this week's update. As you can see in the following table, I have a couple of activities planned that I will do in order to get my desired result: Research & Planning.

# Setting up

For this project I am going to describe a couple of processes I went through. This week's all about setting up the project, doing my research and plan ahead.

## Learning goal and Deliverable

Defining the learning goal and deliverable

I am going to dive deep into the **JAMstack**, a technology stack to create fast, responsive, secure, robust, lightweight apps & websites with JavaScript, APIs, and Markup; the serverless way.

And thus my learning goal shall be:

> Learn the ins and outs of JAMstack and how to work with it.

In order to test my learnings I have a deliverable set, namely:

> The portfolio website for my company, Miles.

## Choosing a theme

> Choosing a theme for the deliverable

My theme will revolve around my company, Miles. We will use the website as a way of showing people our services and past work.

## Situation & Problem

Currently Miles is in the proces of a rebranding. This means that next to a new style and tone of voice, Miles will also need a proper new website to refer to clients. The problem that we have experienced at Miles in the past couple of weeks is that a lot of our clients want to refer us to potential new clients, but always ask for a website that they can share. Seeing that we are growing rapidly as a company and culture too, we feel it's neccesary to start building the website with the most modern technologies.

In short, to solve this problem, I will plan activities (which you can see further on in this week's documentation) to do for the upcoming weeks that will help me code and evaluate the website with my team members. To facilitate this, I will be having a weekly check-in with the members of my team to see if everythin aligns and work on any feedback that's provided. I will do my best to record these meetings where possible.

### The design I will be working with

Within Miles we have a couple of very talented designers and while at the core, Miles was the company I started, it has grown to something much bigger. That's why I have decided to take my hands off of the design for the new website, and let our designers handle it. Normally I would want to have my say, but for the scope of this project I came to the conclusion that sticking to the JAMstack was my main priority.

Now, that's out of the way and it's time to present to you the design of the website I will be coding using the JAMstack methodology.

### The needs for the website

Based on this design I had a co-creation session with Daniel and Ezra, my two main team members. We sat down and decided what the needs for the website would be, technically. We came up with the following list:

* need 1

### The goal for the website

With the needs for the website in place, we can now define the goal for the website. 

# Research the JAMstack

Now that I have a clear understanding of the current situation and problem it's time to do my research on the JAMstack, and decide what my planning is going to look like. When looking at the JAMstack it becomes very clear that there are a lot of different companies marketing the same thing. A lot of frameworks, CMS'es and build systems. I think it's important to first understand what the JAMstack is.

In the lecture I attended by Tim, we learned that there are a few key players in the game. One of them being Netlify. Netlify originated the term JAMstack and explains it as follows:

As you can see there are no databases or web servers neccesary such as is the case with WordPress. You can easily switch your front end and back end based on your needs while still having a very easy to setup project.

From this research I came to the conclusion that there are a couple of main things that every JAMstack website needs:

* A static site generator
* A "headless" CMS (this is a CMS that can connect to any front end system)
* A build and hosting service

So as you might think, my quest to find the right tools started. I came accross two websites that list all the [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com) and [headless CMS'es](https://headlesscms.org) based on popularity.

When looking at that website it became clear to me that there was a lot of choice. That's why I consulted Tim and asked for help. He pointed me in the right direction and for the static site generator I am going to try out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It's a framework based on React (which I already have some experience with) and has a lot of cool stuff built in such as SEO tools. For the headless CMS I went with [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/). From my research on this tool [online](https://henrique.codes/insane-quest-perfect-cms-sanity/) I learnt that it is the most customizable and quick to use, and is being worked on full time. It has proven track record.

Lastly, in order to build the website and deploy it somewhere I am going to go with the biggest player in the game, Netlify. It has a GitHub integration that will work very well with my project and is free to use, even with a SSL certificate for my custom domain name.

Now that I have an idea of the tools I am going to use it's time to plan out the upcoming weeks.

# Planning for the upcoming weeks

As always, I am going to think out the next few weeks, a planning. You can find this planning on the [README.md](https://github.com/mwdossantos/miles) page as well for the overall project.
